        <p>Coding or programming is the procedure in which a person creates a set of instructions in a coding language for computers to complete a specific task. Some of the most commonly known coding languages are Python, Java, Javascript, C++, R, PHP, C#, C, Go and Swift. People use coding to create games and apps that we might use everyday! Coding is a basic skill that you must know. "Whether you want to uncover the secrets of the universe, or you just want to pursue a career in the 21st century, basic computer programming is an essential skill to learn.", says Stephen Hawking, who was very interested in astrology and astrophysics. I do coding and have created many apps using my creativity.</p>
